The scripts in this repository exist to get a list of modules from crash
reports on crash-stats.mozilla.com that were missing symbols, fetch any
of those symbols that exist on Microsoft's symbol server, and upload them
to the Mozilla symbol server.

It is currently configured to run as a daily task in Taskcluster:
https://tools.taskcluster.net/hooks/#project-socorro/fetch-win32-symbols

The task definition used to create the hook task is contained in hook.json.

decision/Dockerfile defines a minimal Docker image (currently
luser/taskcluster-decision:0.1) in which to run the decision task
(run-taskcluster.py) which simply schedules the other tasks
({fetch,upload}-task.json}. The decision task always clones the latest
version of this repository.

The root Dockerfile defines a Docker image (currently
marcocas/breakpad-win-update-symbols) in which to run the symsrv-fetch.py script.
